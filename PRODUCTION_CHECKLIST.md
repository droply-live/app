# Production Readiness Checklist

## ✅ Current Status: READY FOR PRODUCTION

Your application is now configured to handle both test and live Stripe accounts seamlessly.

## 🔧 Environment Variables Setup

### Required for Production
```bash
# Environment
FLASK_ENV=production
ENVIRONMENT=production

# Stripe Configuration
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...                    # Your live Stripe secret key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...                  # Live webhook signing secret
YOUR_DOMAIN=https://yourdomain.com              # Your production domain

# Optional (for development)
REPLIT_DEV_DOMAIN=your-ngrok-domain.ngrok-free.app
```

### Current Test Configuration
```bash
# Environment
FLASK_ENV=development
ENVIRONMENT=development

# Stripe Configuration
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...                    # Test key (current)
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_test_...             # Test webhook secret
YOUR_DOMAIN=https://3bb3b4695c77.ngrok-free.app # ngrok domain (current)
```

## 🚀 Transition Steps

### 1. Stripe Dashboard Setup (Production)
1. **Enable Stripe Connect** in your live Stripe dashboard
2. **Configure Connect settings**:
   - Business name and support email
   - Branding (logo, colors)
   - Payout schedule (recommended: daily/weekly)
3. **Set up webhooks**:
   - Endpoint: `https://yourdomain.com/stripe/webhook`
   - Events: `checkout.session.completed`, `payout.paid`, `payout.failed`
   - Copy the webhook signing secret

### 2. Environment Variables
```bash
# Update your .env file or deployment environment
export STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
export STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
export YOUR_DOMAIN=https://yourdomain.com
```

### 3. Database Migration (if needed)
```bash
# Run the migration script if you haven't already
python migrate_stripe_connect.py
```

### 4. Test the Transition
1. **Deploy with new environment variables**
2. **Test expert onboarding** with a small group
3. **Verify webhook delivery** in Stripe dashboard
4. **Test payment flow** end-to-end
5. **Verify payout process** works correctly

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### ✅ Already Implemented
- **Webhook signature verification** - Prevents webhook spoofing
- **Environment-based configuration** - No hardcoded secrets
- **Production safeguards** - Prevents test keys in production
- **Proper error handling** - No sensitive data exposure
- **HTTPS enforcement** - Secure communication

### 🛡️ Production Safeguards
The application now includes automatic safeguards that:

1. **Prevent test keys in production** - App will fail to start if test keys are detected in production
2. **Block test payments in production** - Payment routes return errors if test keys are used
3. **Protect webhooks** - Webhook endpoints reject requests if environment mismatch detected
4. **Environment validation** - Checks `FLASK_ENV` and `ENVIRONMENT` variables
5. **Graceful degradation** - Shows user-friendly error messages instead of technical errors

### ⚠️ Additional Recommendations
- **Rate limiting** - Consider implementing API rate limits
- **Monitoring** - Set up alerts for failed payments/payouts
- **Logging** - Ensure proper audit trails
- **Backup strategy** - Regular database backups

## 💰 Fee Structure

### Current Implementation
- **Platform fee**: 10% of transaction amount
- **Stripe fee**: 2.9% + 30¢ per transaction
- **Connect fee**: 0.25% for Express accounts
- **Payout fee**: $0.25 per payout (US bank accounts)

### Example Calculation
- Client pays: $100
- Stripe fee: $3.20 (2.9% + 30¢)
- Platform fee: $10 (10%)
- Expert receives: $86.80
- Your profit: $6.80

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Before Going Live
1. **Test with real Stripe Connect accounts** (small amounts)
2. **Verify webhook delivery** and processing
3. **Test refund scenarios** and cancellation flows
4. **Verify payout scheduling** and processing
5. **Test error scenarios** (failed payments, declined cards)

### Monitoring Checklist
- [ ] Webhook delivery success rate > 99%
- [ ] Payment success rate > 95%
- [ ] Payout success rate > 99%
- [ ] Average payout processing time < 2 business days
- [ ] No webhook signature verification failures

## 🚨 Rollback Plan

If issues arise, you can quickly rollback:

1. **Revert environment variables** to test keys
2. **Update webhook endpoints** to test URLs
3. **Switch domain** back to development URL
4. **Monitor** for any data inconsistencies

## 📊 Production Metrics to Track

### Financial Metrics
- Total transaction volume
- Platform fee revenue
- Payout processing times
- Failed payment rate
- Refund rate

### Technical Metrics
- Webhook delivery success rate
- API response times
- Database performance
- Error rates by endpoint

### User Experience Metrics
- Expert onboarding completion rate
- Payment success rate
- Payout request frequency
- Support ticket volume

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Set up production Stripe Connect** in your dashboard
2. **Configure production webhooks**
3. **Update environment variables**
4. **Deploy to production**
5. **Test with a small group of experts**
6. **Monitor closely for the first week**
7. **Scale up gradually**
