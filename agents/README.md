# ProcuraAI - Agentic Procurement System

## ü§ñ Overview

ProcuraAI transforms your static procurement database into an intelligent, autonomous procurement co-pilot. The system consists of specialized AI agents that work together to automate procurement processes, provide insights, and handle complex queries through natural language.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Agent Manager** - Orchestrates all agents and manages their lifecycle
2. **Context Manager** - Provides shared memory and coordination between agents
3. **Natural Language Interface** - ChatGPT-like interface for cross-module insights
4. **Specialized Agents** - Each handling specific procurement functions

### Agent Types

| Agent | Purpose | Capabilities |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| **RFQ Agent** | Autonomous Sourcing Assistant | Auto-source suppliers, generate RFQ content, parse quotes, build comparisons |
| **Order Agent** | Follow-Up & Delay Tracker | Monitor deliveries, escalate delays, sync with ERP, predict delays |
| **Supplier Agent** | Supplier Intelligence Analyst | Calculate performance scores, flag anomalies, suggest alternatives |
| **Contract Agent** | Contract Guardian | Monitor terms, track renewals, alert expirations, ensure compliance |

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Access the AI Interface

Navigate to `/agents/chat` in your browser to access the ChatGPT-like interface.

### 2. Try Example Queries

- "Show me suppliers who quoted this month but didn't win any RFQs"
- "Find open POs with overdue delivery by more than 5 days"
- "Show me all expiring contracts in the next 30 days"
- "Which suppliers have the best performance ratings?"

### 3. Monitor System Status

Visit `/agents/dashboard` to see the status of all agents and system metrics.

## üì° API Endpoints

### Core Endpoints

- `GET /agents/status` - Get overall system status
- `POST /agents/query` - Process natural language query
- `GET /agents/agents` - Get all agents status
- `GET /agents/agents/<agent_id>` - Get specific agent status

### Procurement Endpoints

- `POST /agents/rfq` - Create new RFQ
- `POST /agents/rfq/response` - Process quote response
- `POST /agents/order` - Create new order
- `POST /agents/order/delay` - Report order delay

### Interface Endpoints

- `GET /agents/chat` - AI chat interface
- `GET /agents/dashboard` - Agent dashboard
- `GET /agents/history` - Query history

## üîß Integration Examples

### Basic Integration

```python
from agents.flask_integration import (
    process_natural_language_query,
    trigger_rfq_created,
    trigger_order_created
)

# Process a natural language query
result = process_natural_language_query(
    "Show me underperforming suppliers",
    user_id="user123"
)

# Trigger RFQ creation
rfq_data = {
    'rfq_id': 'RFQ-001',
    'part_name': 'Bolt M8x20',
    'specifications': 'Stainless steel, ISO 4017',
    'quantity': 1000,
    'delivery_date': '2024-03-15'
}
success = trigger_rfq_created(rfq_data)
```

### Advanced Integration

```python
from agents.integration_example import (
    add_agentic_routes,
    integrate_with_existing_routes,
    add_ai_insights_to_dashboard
)

# Add agentic routes to your app
add_agentic_routes(app)

# Get integration functions
integration_functions = integrate_with_existing_routes()

# In your existing booking creation route
@app.route('/create_booking', methods=['POST'])
def create_booking():
    # ... existing logic ...
    
    # Notify AI agents
    integration_functions['on_booking_created'](booking_data)
    
    # ... rest of route ...
```

- **Track delays** and escalate automatically
- **Sync with ERP** systems
- **Auto-update statuses** based on supplier communications
- **Chat with suppliers** about delays
- **Predict delays** using historical data

### Supplier Agent
- **Calculate performance scores** based on multiple metrics
- **Flag anomalies** in supplier behavior
- **Suggest alternatives** when suppliers underperform
- **Analyze trends** and patterns
- **Monitor quality** and competitiveness
- **Track price** fluctuations

### Contract Agent

## üîç Natural Language Queries

The system understands complex procurement queries in natural language:

### Supplier Performance
- "Show me suppliers who quoted this month but didn't win any RFQs"
- "Which suppliers have the best performance ratings?"
- "Find suppliers with quality issues in the last quarter"

### Order Tracking
- "Find open POs with overdue delivery by more than 5 days"
- "What orders are at risk of delay?"
- "Show me all orders from Supplier A"

### Contract Management
- "Show me all expiring contracts in the next 30 days"
- "Which contracts are underused?"
- "Find contracts with price escalation clauses"

### RFQ Analysis
- "Analyze recent RFQ responses and recommend the best supplier"
- "Show me the most competitive quotes this month"
- "Which RFQs need attention?"

## üìä System Monitoring
