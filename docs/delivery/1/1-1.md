## Requirements

- Remove the $5 minimum floor from platform fee calculation
- Keep the 10% calculation only
- Update related documentation to reflect the change

## Implementation Plan

1. Update `routes.py` line 2907 to remove `max(5.0, ...)` wrapper
2. Update `routes.py` line 2981 (POST handler) to remove `max(5.0, ...)` wrapper
3. Update `routes.py` line 1747 (refund calculation) to remove `max(5.0, ...)` wrapper
4. Update documentation in `docs/STRIPE_CONNECT_SETUP.md`
5. Verify documentation in `docs/PRODUCTION_CHECKLIST.md`

## Test Plan

### Objective
Verify that platform fee is calculated as exactly 10% of session fee with no minimum.

### Test Scope
- Booking confirmation calculation logic (GET and POST handlers)
- Refund calculation logic
- Documentation accuracy

### Success Criteria
- Platform fee = session_fee * 0.10 for all session prices
- Documentation reflects the updated fee structure
- No $5 minimum is applied in any calculation

## Verification

- [x] Code updated in `routes.py` (3 locations: lines 2907, 2981, 1747)
- [x] Documentation updated in `STRIPE_CONNECT_SETUP.md` (2 sections)
- [x] Documentation accurate in `PRODUCTION_CHECKLIST.md` (already correct)
- [x] Comments updated to reflect new logic
- [x] Verified no instances of `max(5.0, ... * 0.10)` remain in codebase

## Files Modified

- `routes.py` (lines 2907, 2981, 1747)
- `docs/STRIPE_CONNECT_SETUP.md` (lines 106-114, 190-192)
